## Practical Details

### 1. **Depth First Search (DFS) & Breadth First Search (BFS)**
- **Objective:** Implement DFS and BFS algorithms using an undirected graph and recursive functions for searching all vertices of a graph or tree.
- **Description:** This practical explores graph traversal algorithms, implementing both DFS and BFS recursively to search through a graph structure.

### 2. **A* Search Algorithm**
- **Objective:** Implement the A* algorithm for any game search problem.
- **Description:** The A* algorithm is a pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm used to find the shortest path from the start node to the goal node.

### 3. **Greedy Search Algorithms**
   - **Selection Sort:** Implement the greedy algorithm for sorting data using the selection sort technique.
   - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** Apply greedy techniques to find the MST in a graph.
   - **Single-Source Shortest Path Problem:** Implement the greedy approach for solving the shortest path problem.
   - **Job Scheduling Problem:** Use greedy methods to solve scheduling problems efficiently.
   - **Prim's MST Algorithm:** Implement Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree.
   - **Kruskal's MST Algorithm:** Implement Kruskal's algorithm to solve the minimum spanning tree problem.
   - **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm:** Apply the greedy technique to solve the single-source shortest path problem.

### 4. **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**
   - **Branch and Bound & Backtracking (N-Queens Problem / Graph Coloring):**
   - **Objective:** Implement the Branch and Bound and Backtracking algorithms to solve constraint satisfaction problems like the N-Queens problem or the Graph Coloring problem.

### 5. **Elementary Chatbot Development**
- **Objective:** Develop a simple chatbot application that can handle customer interactions.
- **Description:** This practical focuses on building a basic chatbot for automated customer service or query resolution.

### 6. **Expert Systems**
- **Objective:** Develop an expert system for one of the following applications:
   - Information Management
   - Hospitals and Medical Facilities
   - Help Desks Management
   - Employee Performance Evaluation
   - Stock Market Trading
   - Airline Scheduling and Cargo Schedules
- **Description:** Implement an expert system to make decisions or provide solutions based on input data within a specific domain.

### 7. **Cloud Computing Applications**
   - **Case Study on Amazon EC2:** Learn about Amazon EC2 services and their use in cloud computing for scalable computing.
   - **Google App Engine Configuration:** Install and configure the Google App Engine, exploring its capabilities for cloud applications.
   - **SalesForce Application Development:** Learn about Salesforce and create a custom application using the Apex programming language.
